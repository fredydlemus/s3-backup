# Backup to AWS S3 Github Action

Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

### ðŸš§ Under Construction ðŸš§

Currently, this GitHub Action is a work in progress. We are working hard to have it ready for use soon. We greatly appreciate your patience and understanding as we continue to improve and finalize the details.

This action is designed to back up your repository to an S3 bucket using OpenID Connect. Stay tuned for updates, we hope to have this action available very soon! If you have any suggestions or just want to say hi, feel free to open an issue or send a pull request.

Thank you for your interest and support. See you soon! ðŸ˜Š
