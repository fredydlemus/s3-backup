To report a security issue, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

2. Instead, please send an email to [fredydlemus.dev@gmail.com] with the subject line "Security Vulnerability Report: Backup to AWS S3 Action".

3. In your email, please include:
   - A description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact of the vulnerability
   - Any possible mitigations you've identified

4. Allow us some time to investigate and respond to your report before disclosing it publicly.

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours and will send you regular updates about our progress.

## Security Update Process

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
2. Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
3. Prepare fixes for all supported versions.
4. Release new versions as soon as possible.

## Public Disclosure

We believe in transparency and will publicly disclose vulnerabilities once a fix has been fully developed and tested. We will credit you for discovering and reporting the issue unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

Thank you for helping to keep our GitHub Action and its users secure!
